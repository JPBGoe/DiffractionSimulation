# DiffractionSimulation
Aim of the project:
This project is essentially only done for two purposes. The first is to learn/ practice how to use gitHub. Especially, which options one has and how to structure and document the project. The second aspect this project is aiming at is to learn python3.

Description of the problem this project deals with:
This repository should simulate the diffraction  pattern of a 2D object. For this purpose, a temporal coherent light source is assumed.

Usage:
Make sure that the object is properly sampled.
